Hello, I am Nikhitha Bijjala, currently pursuing my master's in computer science.
I have work experience of 13 months in which for the first 6 months I was a software engineer trainee, during this period I was trained on&nbsp;HTML, CSS, JS, Angular, React, and React native. For the rest of the months, I worked as a mobile application developer, my responsibilities included enhancing existing client's mobile applications using react native.
I'm also skilled at a few programming languages&nbsp; C, Java, and Python.
I have enrolled in this course as, I'm inclined to enhance my skills and excited to put my learning into real-time projects, and this course gives me such an opportunity where I can fulfill both of them.
